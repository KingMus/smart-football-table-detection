### Calculations for Camera (Logitech Webcam)

* Frame = 600px
* Camera-Angle = 33.3985째 (height) & 43.6028째 (width)

Base of Calculation:

Messure of screen size: 40cm\*30cm (w\*h) <br>
Messure of Camera height: 50cm <br>
Getting angle with tangens: tan(alpha_width/2) = (screensize/2)/cameraheight = 20/50 = 0.4, so alpha_width = 43.6028째 <br>
Getting angle with tangens: tan(alpha_height /2) = (screensize/2)/cameraheight = 15/50 = 0.3, so alpha_height = 33.3985째 <br>
